			 <p>Today I learnt about &lsquo;being glue&rsquo;:</p>

<img src="uploads/2025/3148652da5.png" alt="Being glue by Tanya Reilly - lead dev at Squarespace. Engineering team success is not just about showing up and churning out code, sometimes the glue work falls to juniors who don't get properly recognised. Examples of glue work include writing docs, setting up team meetings, establishing coding standards, improving team processes, mentoring and coaching, improving new member onboarding. Even if you're doing the highest impact work, acting in a leadership capacity, and recieving glowing feedback, the company might not consider it engineering work.">

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I find the actual technical side of creating a blog so much more fun than the actual writing side. It’s weird!</p>
<p>I could spend countless hours trying to fitz around with CSS or adjusting some JavaScript to do something like add little fancy spinning buttons that link to somewhere else on the internet.</p>
<p>What I seem to struggle with is the writing bit. Why is this? All I need to do is to get my thoughts down, but when I try it feels like nothing comes to me to write about. Sure, I’ve done lots of cool and interesting things but surely no one would want to read about those.  I overthink writing way too much and that turns into not writing anything at all.</p>
<p>So how can I solve this? I’m not sure. First I’m going to try to remove the barriers that made it more difficult to write for me before: I had a Jekyll powered website and while everything was in a Markdown file in GitHub it was a bit of a pain to actually write out something because I’d be really picky about the images not looking quite right or the design looking a bit off.</p>
<p>I’m going to start with micro blogs, inspired by <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, to capture my small &lsquo;writings/posts/jots&rsquo; of writing and mix that in with a bit more of long-form writing.</p>
<p>I’ll pin the long-form stuff so that it’s a bit more visible and I can show it off. I’ll try to make it frictionless to write more, even in tiny small amounts, and then I’ll try to read up on how other people have done it. I can’t be the only one facing this problem: how do I even get started with writing content for a blog? Many people have been here before, and persevered, so I can do it too.</p>
<p>Before I made this post, I read: <a href="http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/">“How to blog about code and give zero fucks”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to the subject of this post, which is that you, developer in an underrepresented group who hopefully received this link somehow through the magical machinations of social media, should be blogging more. I need you to blog more. Little future developers who look or act or dress or think like you need you to blog more. Your slightly confused and defensive developer community needs you to blog more. Please please please please. And if you are like, &ldquo;I give zero fucks about what those people need, I need to get off work at six and build charming birdhouses or customize my bicycle or something,&rdquo; the best part is giving zero fucks is totally fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can do it! You can too.</p>
<p>Now here’s where I open it up: do you have any resources to share on how you have gotten started with blogging? Specifically how do you actually get words down? I’d be interested in hearing from others, so please share anything you might think could be helpful. 😊</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I&rsquo;ve given an update on how the server cabinet is going. Well, snugg.ie has had a bit of an upgrade!</p>
<p>As you might&rsquo;ve noticed, we&rsquo;re in a totally new cabinet now! The <a href="https://posts.snugg.ie/posts/server-cabinet">older wooden cabinet</a>  outlived its lifespan after a few house moves. It was also never originally designed to be disassembled, which was its biggest hindrance.</p>
<p>The setup has now moved into a whole new 24U enclosure (Lehmann) made of metal. It&rsquo;s disassemble-able and has sound-dampening foam, which gets everywhere 🌨️!</p>

<li>totally new network setup! New VLANs, FTTx XGS-PON full-fibre wired directly into router using a WAS-110 ONT/ONU &lsquo;on a stick&rsquo; SFP+ module</li>
<li>a lot more smart-home gear running through a Home Assistant ZBT-1, including <a href="https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-lite">Everything presence sensors</a>, smart light bulbs (Philips Hue &amp; Twinkly), and more!</li>
<li>using Docker containers for pretty much all of my services with docker-compose</li>

<p>On average the whole cabinet draws 340 watts, about 8.38 kWh total a day, which using current UK energy prices is around £2/day. It&rsquo;s an expensive hobby to keep, so bear in mind if you&rsquo;re looking to getting into self-hosting things yourself!</p>

<p>Now after <a href="/posts/hug-server">building a server</a> for self-hosting things, there&rsquo;s no-where to put it!</p>
<p>Most server cabinets that people can buy online are either <em>way too expensive</em> or way too big &rsquo;n&rsquo; heavy to ship properly. So, how could I make a cabinet of my own yet still make it functional?</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid the ever-popular <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack">LackRack</a> where people buy <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lack-side-table-black-20011408/">an Ikea table</a> to use as their server rack, which even comes with a <a href="http://eth-0.nl/lackrack.pdf">handy instruction manual</a>, as it doesn&rsquo;t actually have any proper mounting holes. I didn&rsquo;t like the thought of screwing all this expensive equipment directly into into the particle wood and also not being able to use the sliding rails that come with many server chassis. I was also planning to add a heavy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS</a> at some point, which also ruled out this option.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have a lot of spare wood lying around from an old shed that had to be demolished, so I was thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>How could I make a server cabinet of my own? And have it be functional? Perhaps even more functional than most server cabinets, which just sit in the corner of a basement and collect dust?</p>
<p>A wild idea appeared!</p>
<blockquote>
<div>💡 Make the server cabinet also be a coffee table!</div>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="lets-get-going">Let&rsquo;s get going&hellip;</h2>
<h3 id="cut-some-wood">Cut some wood!</h3>
<p>We need to follow a plan, some kind of plan, but a plan! One thing that would be incredibly useful is a hinged door at the front, as a lot of server cabinets have glass front doors. Another useful addition would be a removable panel at the back for moving cables around and managing things easier.</p>
<p>Next we need to look into how we could rack-mount things. Thankfully, I could find a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit">12U</a> server mounting strips online, which would mean that my cabinet&rsquo;s internal height would be roughly 53.34cm. The next part was also to start constructing the basic frame out of sticks o&rsquo; wood, making a rough &lsquo;O&rsquo; shape for each side.</p>
<p>Most of this project was just finding things that were lying around and using those. For example, we used No. 10 x 2-1/2&quot; 5mm x 60mm Woodscrews and No. 8 x 1-1/4&quot; 4mm x 30mm Woodscrews. Why? They were lying around and they worked!</p>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/d752472d3c.jpg" alt="A quick sketch of the server cabinet/coffee table idea">
<img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/eb6484e3ba.jpg" alt="A slightly refined sketch of what the cabinet would look like with actual proposed measurements">

<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/26e154ef6d.jpg" alt="A picture showing the frame being completed with the server mounted inside using rails"></p>
<p>(Note how we&rsquo;re using <a href="/posts/hug-server">the server</a> as a guideline for the exact width needed! Easier and more accurate than measuring by center-widths.)</p>
<p>Next we can start measuring things up. I would need two different types of plank. One long length for planking up the sides and another shorter one for planking up the front/rear doors. From this point, it was all sanding, adding screws, hinges and a lot of re-measuring to make sure things went right.</p>

<hr>
<p>This project was loads of fun and it&rsquo;s super useful, it&rsquo;s now in the middle of our living room and sees constant daily use, for multiple purposes! In terms of thermals, everything is pretty alright due to plenty of gaps all over. One thing to keep in mind though, is that noise needs to be kept to a minimum and you might even need to replace some of the fans inside of server components.</p>
<p>And finally, thank you so much for all the help putting this together and sawing so much wood, <a href="https://mastodon.art/@cinnabyn">@cinnabyn</a>!</p>
<p>Would I do it again? <strong>Yes!</strong></p>

<p>Let me tell you the tale of my experiences with home servers (&lsquo;Homelab&rsquo; equipment).</p>
<p>As I was experimenting within tech, I found that I loved hosting little services and such to make my life easier. From <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, a cloud storage replacement similar to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>, to a personal VPN with <a href="https://wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a>, my requirements ended up expanding to the point where I was spending up to £35/month on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">rented VPS</a>.</p>
<p>This couldn&rsquo;t continue! Things were getting too expensive and I didn&rsquo;t like keeping my <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> storage in the cloud — it was slow.
Enter&hellip; Hug Server.</p>

<h3 id="lets-find-a-chassis-and-motherboard">Let&rsquo;s find a chassis and motherboard!</h3>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/95782e0212.jpg" alt="Inside of server purchased">
I ended up wandering upon an eBay listing for a Sandy Bridge server which was only £70.</p>
<p>This was awesome! It included an 8-thread <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/52273/intel-xeon-processor-e3-1240-8m-cache-3-30-ghz.html">Intel Xeon E3-1240</a> CPU plus an <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/53557/intel-server-board-s1200btl.html">Intel S1200BTL</a> motherboard. The most important part for me, though, was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201204043130/https://www.ri-vier.eu/rivier-2u-12bay-chassis-with-sas-backplane-rvs206a-p-323.html">Ri-Vier RVS2-06A</a> chassis with <strong>included rails</strong> and a 12-bay hotswappable SAS/SATA backplane. This was perfect for building a custom server within, as there were no OEM or proprietary parts — I could fit any components I&rsquo;d like because there weren&rsquo;t any weird form factors to think about. It even used a standard PSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/f8d7032133.jpg" alt="Motherboard purchased, ASUS Z10PE-D8 WS"></p>
<p>The next part came along when I saw a motherboard that should&rsquo;ve been worth about £500 at the time, which I bought for only £87. The ASUS Z10PE-D8 WS: a Haswell semi-workstation/server board with seven x16 PCIe lanes. It was so affordable
because it <em>&lsquo;had a bent CPU2 socket pin&rsquo;</em> and the seller wasn&rsquo;t sure if the second socket would still work, as they only had one CPU to test with. I tested it myself, there were no issues!</p>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/3a00b95541.jpg" alt="Screenshot of eBay listing for motherboard"></p>
<h3 id="now-to-make-it-smart-to-hunt-some-cpu-and-memory">Now to make it smart, to hunt some CPU and memory!</h3>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/02b871fa4c.jpg" alt="A picture of one of the CPUs used, Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3."></p>
<p>As very few people actually have Haswell server motherboards, the CPUs sell for relatively cheap! I managed to purchase two Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3&rsquo;s for £30/ea, giving me a total of 32 threads at 2.4–3.2 GHz for £60.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t have too much issue finding memory. I found three 16 GB sticks of DDR4 RDIMM ECC for £20/ea (All prices including shipping) which would give me a total of 48 GB which I could easily expand up to 128 GB.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together-like-lego">Putting it all together like LEGO</h3>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/a92dfe17f5.jpg" alt="Motherboard full assembled">
<img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/7a3d385a3e.jpg" alt="Installing motherboard into 2U chassis, next to PSU"></p>
<p>All that was left was to put everything together! Pop the two processors in their socket, install the memory and we&rsquo;re off to the races! There actually wasn&rsquo;t any issue with bent CPU pins, everything worked pretty much out of the box. This motherboard also supports IPMI with an addin-module.</p>
<p>The motherboard was an extremely tight fit, as it is designed to the EEB specification, whereas this chassis was designed for a CEB motherboard. This wasn&rsquo;t too much of an issue, I just put in as many standoffs as I could and also added some cork spacers underneath for extra support. It just about fit with barely a millimetre of clearance. After this, I purchased two Supermicro SMH SNK-P0048AP4 heatsinks since I needed some fans in this chassis and then closed it up!</p>
<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/fc2e975606.jpg" alt="Both heatsinks being shown with the fans running">

<p><img src="https://snugg.ie/uploads/2024/6263627a1d.jpg" alt="Quick screenshot from neofetch, showing the operating system running (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and system specs"></p>
<p>For this server, I would like to be able to virtualise and/or containerize many different services. I had a few choices here! I could use something popular like Proxmox or VMWare&rsquo;s ESXi, but this would be entirely for personal use and I would also like my web dashboards to look aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>I am familiar with Fedora, as I use both Fedora and MacOS on my personal devices, and there is a web dashboard known as Cockpit which is included by default with Fedora server, but I would prefer a more stable release cycle for updates. This is why I&rsquo;d chose Red Hat Enterprise Linux for my host OS and then I could use Cockpit&rsquo;s QEMU/KVM module plus some command-line to manage all of my virtual machines! (Plus Cockpit&rsquo;s Podman for Docker containers)</p>
